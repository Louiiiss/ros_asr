423c0215 INSTEAD OF SECURITIES FUNDS MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE FILINGS OF LARGE SHARE PURCHASES MADE ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS

052c0101 THOUGH THE NEED FOR ECONOMY HAS ALSO HELD THAT A HANDFUL EXPENSIVE BUT ALL IMPORTANT MARKETED WILL SERVE AS THE FALL A GROUP OF PEOPLE OVER MANY YEARS 
052c0102 FOR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNMENT LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE WAY ELDERLY PEOPLE MOVE FROM INDEPENDENT LIVING IN COMMUNITY CARE TO PERHAPS A NURSING HOME OR HOSPITAL 
052c0103 WITH SUCH KNOWLEDGE PLANNERS COULD BETTER DETERMINE WHETHER MORE COMMITTEE CARE FACILITIES COULD REDUCE THE NEED FOR NURSING HOMES OR HOSPITALS

053c0103 A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE DEPARTMENT SAID NO SUCH DECISION HAD BEEN MADE YET 
053c0104 IN ADDITION I. B. M.'S PRICING STRATEGY COULD HURT COMPETITORS 
053c0105 FOR EXAMPLE THE COMPANY PLANS BIG DISCOUNTS ON THE NEW ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DOLLAR MACHINE FOR SCHOOLS A MAIN APPLE MARKET 
053c0106 ONE OF THE NEW P. C. THE OFFERS ALMOST DOUBLE THE MEMORY OF SLIGHTLY MORE STORES FOR ELEVEN PERCENT LAST THAT THE COMPETING COMPAQ MACHINE

053c0108 THE TASK FORCE REPORT ISN'T ALL BAD 
053c0109 IT DOES CALL FOR ELIMINATING SOME GOVERNMENT OBSTACLES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HEALTHY LOT TERM CARE INSURANCE MARKET 
053c010a AND THE IDEA OF LETTING EMPLOYERS PRE FUND POST RETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSES THAT SURELY BETTER THAN HAVING GOVERNMENT DO IT 
053c010b ACTIVELY TRADED THIRTY YEAR TREASURY ISSUES LAST WEEK PLUNGED ABOUT THREE POINTS OR ABOUT THIRTY DOLLARS FOR EACH ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR FACE AMOUNT

053c010r ONE OF THE FEW AREAS OF STRONG GROWTH EARLIER IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WAS THE NEW ISSUE MARKET FOR INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES AND EQUITY RELATED BONDS 
053c010s SUCH ACTIVITY HAS ALL THE END IT SENT STOCK PRICES PLUNGED THE ANALYSTS SAY 
053c010t INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS FEEL THE RISE BY SHIFTING ASSETS TO THE FUNDS IN RESPONSE TO DECLINING RATES AVAILABLE ON SHORT TERM SECURITIES ON THE MARKET 
053c010u ALSO INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS CONCERN OF THE VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE SHE SAID 
053c010v LAST FRIDAY THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE POSTED ITS THIRD BIGGEST POINT DECLINE EVER

053c010z JOB SECURITY CLAUSES GIVE UNION SOMETHING POSITIVE TO TAKE BACK TO THEIR MEMBERS AT A MODEST COST TO THE PLAYERS 
053c0110 BUT THEY CAN LOOK MORE GENEROUS THAN THEY ARE 
053c0111 I'LL CONTACTS PROVIDE FOR JOB SECURITY BUT BECAUSE THEY LIMIT THE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR IT THEY HAVEN'T PREVENTED SIZABLE LAYOFFS 
053c0112 WE COULD DISTRIBUTE THE BONDS IN JAPAN IN EUROPE IN THE U. K. BUT NOT IN THE U. S. MR. LABRECQUE HE SAID 
053c0113 THESE POWERS ARE IMPORTANT TO US 
053c0114 OUR CUSTOMERS WANT THEM 
053c0115 THE QUESTION IS WHETHER U. S. BANKS WILL BE ALLOWED TO COMPETE 
22gc0101 THE ROBINS SAID MR. WOLF FORTY THREE YEARS OLD IS LEAVING AFTER THIRTEEN YEARS WITH THE COMPANY FOR POSITION WITH THE TEXAS HEALTH CARE CONCERN 
22gc0102 MR. WOLF SAID THE NEW JOB WILL BE PRIME EARLY BUSINESS WORRY THAT

22gc0105 EVEN IF JAPANESE INVESTORS DON'T SELL DOLLARS SOME THAT YIELDS WILL  HE SAYS 
22gc0106 THAT TREND IS INEVITABLE UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT HAS AUTHORITY OVER THE WHOLE WORLD 
22gc0107 CONGRESS AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAD BEGUN TO TAKE THE RIGHT STEPS TO APPROVE TO CREDIT BUDGET 
22gc0108 A PILOT LOAN SALE PROGRAM APPROVED LAST YEAR WOULD PROVIDE OF VIRTUALLY RISK FREE TEST OF THIS APPROACH 
22gc0109 INITIAL WALL STREET ENTHUSIASM HAS SURPRISED EVEN PRIVATIZATION ADVOCATES 
22gc010a THE FIRST SALES ARE EXPECTED TO GO TO MARKET SOMETIME THIS SUMMER 
22gc010b THE OFFERING WILL COMPRISE SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF BONDS DUE NOVEMBER SECOND AND SIX HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF BONDS MATURING NEXT FEBRUARY FIRST 
22gc010c ALL THE BONDS WILL BE DATED NEXT MONDAY 
22gc010d INTEREST RATES WILL BE ANNOUNCED WEDNESDAY 
22gc010e THE CENTRAL BANKS HAVE LITTLE CHANCE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THE DOLLAR'S FALL 
22gc010f ONE POSSIBLE THAT TRIED TO REDUCE THEIR U. S. CURRENCY PORTFOLIOS BY SELLING DOLLARS BACK INTO CALMER MARKETS 
22gc010g TRADERS SAY THE BUNDESBANK DID THIS ONE THE DOLLAR STRENGTHENED IN LATE JULY AND EARLY AUGUST

22gc010o THERE ARE TWO ISSUES TO CONSIDER 
22gc010p FIRST WHAT WAS ADMIRAL POINDEXTER'S BELIEF ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S POLICY OF HELPING THE NICARAGUAN DEMOCRATIC RESISTANCE 
22gc010q SECOND DUE TO ADMIRAL POINDEXTER BELIEVE WHAT HE AND COLONEL NORTH WERE DOING WAS LEGAL 
22gc010r CERTAIN PRICES HAVE RISEN AT A BRISK PACE THROUGHOUT THIS DECADE 
22gc010s HEALTH CARE INFLATION FOR INSTANCE HASN'T DROPPED BELOW SIX PERCENT ANNUALLY THAN THE COST OF EDUCATION HAS RISEN EVEN FASTER 
22gc010t BUT UNTIL RECENTLY INFLATION AND HEALTH EDUCATION AND OTHER SERVICES WAS OFFSET BY FLAT OR FALLING PRICES FOR MANY MANUFACTURED GOODS AND FARM COMMODITIES 
22gc010u THE DECLINE IN THE DOLLAR AND THE CONTINUED STRENGTH IN THE ECONOMY HOWEVER ARE NOW ADDING DEMANDED QUOTAS AND THOSE PRICES TO RISE TOO 
22gc010v THE LOGIC APPARENTLY IS THAT WE'LL HAVE TO RAISE THEIR RATES TO DEFEND THE DOLLAR SAID PETER CANELO A PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST AT BEAR STEARNS 
22gc010w BODY SAID THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE TRUE IF THE DOLLAR WERE WEAK 
22gc010x SINCE THE U. S. CURRENCY HAS SPURRED THAN SHARPLY IN RECENT WEEKS HE SEES NO NEED FOR THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO RAISE INTEREST RATES TO PROTECT THE DOLLAR 
22gc010y MANY INSTITUTIONAL PLAYERS CONFESS TO HOLDING MORE CASH THAN USUAL 
22gc010z IN THE BULL MARKET OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX TO EIGHTY SEVEN CASH POSITIONS EXCEEDED FIVE PERCENT OF ASSETS WOULD HAVE HELD DOWN OVERALL RETURNS
