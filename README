Install ROS (indigo or kinetic)
Create a catkin_directory 
catkin_make

Baxter installation:	
http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Simulator_Installation
*you may have to enable execution of baxter.sh to run simulation*
	- run "chmod u+x baxter.sh"
*edit ROS Distro, IP and baxter serial number in shell script in order to run physical*

make sure you've sourced the workspace
To run the base demo, run
roscore
roslaunch baxter_gazebo baxter_world.launch

REF: https://github.com/lyh458/birl_baxter/tree/master/demos/baxter_end_effector_control

download KALDI from:
http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/S.Fernando/spodiro/basic_spodiro.html

Enter KALDI and run install instructions 

Enter ros_asr/src:
	Edit path.sh, so that KALDI_ROOT has the correct path to your kaldi installation
	Run ./configure.sh
	Run sudo ./install_packages.sh
	Run ./install_portaudio.sh
	cd basic_src
	make

Test with ./asr.sh 0 
(you may have to run "chmod u+x asr.sh")
Try saying "move up", the console should print out MOVE UP if it's working correctly


Install these two:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-trac-ik

http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Baxter_PyKDL


THEN, two kinda tricky bits:
in asr.sh, edit the isolated line preceeded by CHANGET THIS.
This needs to be the path to the folder that file is located in

Second, in kaldi_relay.cpp, change the path on line 32, to this same folder


FINALLY, return to the workstation root (ie, catkin_ws, or ros_ws etc.)
Run catkin_make

To run the demo, 
SIMULATION:
	roscore
	roslaunch baxter_gazebo baxter_world.launch
	roslaunch ros_asr end_effector_voice_control.launch
